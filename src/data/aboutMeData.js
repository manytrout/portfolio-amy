// 		education:
// 			"I earned my front-end web developer (FWD) certificate from BCIT in July of 2023. During the 7-month intensive program offered by BCIT I went from having almost no experience to making apps that called APIs! I started out small, making static websites as I learned to write HTML and CSS and progressed quickly to Sass, JavaScript/React, PHP, WordPress and e-commerce, specifically shopify and WooCommerce.",

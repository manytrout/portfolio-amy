				Hi, I'm Amy! I'm an aspiring web developer. I earned my
				front-end web developer (FWD) certificate from BCIT in July of
				2023. During the 7-month intensive program offered by BCIT I
				went from having almost no experience to making apps that called
				APIs! I started out small, making static websites as I learned
				to write HTML and CSS and progressed quickly to Sass,
				JavaScript/React, PHP, WordPress and e-commerce, specifically
				shopify and WooCommerce.
			</p>
			<p className="background">
				I had been doing application support for years and realized that
				I wanted to start making the kinds of applications that I'd been
				helping users with for so long. After checking out some job
				postings I realized that front-end development would be the
				perfect next step.

				When I'm not at my computer I'm as far away from it as I can
				get. Like a lot of Vancouverites, I spend as much time as I can
				in outside. Hiking {"("}not the intense kind{")"}, swimming,
				snowshoeing, or chilling on a blanket in the park. Ever since I
				was little I've loved to cook and bake for my friends and
				family.{" "}

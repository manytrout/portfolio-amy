			<p className="personalBackground">After years of doing application support  -- for in house web apps and niche software -- I realized that I wanted to shift from supporting apps to making them. Once I started to look into jobs that I could see myself doing, front-end development seemed like the perfect next step.</p>
			<p className="education">I earned my front-end web developer (FWD) certificate from BCIT in July of 2023. During the 7-month intensive program offered by BCIT I went from having almost no experience to making apps that called APIs! I started out small, making static websites as I learned to write HTML and CSS and progressed quickly to Sass, JavaScript/React, PHP, WordPress and e-commerce, specifically shopify and WooCommerce.</p>

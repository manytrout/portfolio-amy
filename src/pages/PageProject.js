// use project title as end of URL (i think)
// this needs:
/* 
image
brief description
(accordion or tabbed) sections for:
* tools used
* process
    * planning, workflow, re-evaluation if necessary
* challenge & resolution
* code snippets with github gists
*/

/*
get to this page either directly  by URL 

OR

clicking on a tile (Project or Fun for now)

Small description
Accordion (with anchor link? do i want the option to expand between 0 and all + ?):
* learning goals as part of larger description
* process (incl planning, re-evaluation if needed)
* tech stack/tools
* snippets w github gist
